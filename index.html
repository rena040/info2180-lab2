                <h2> My Track and Field Experience</h2>

                <p>My track and field journey began when I was only a toddler, yearning to go outside to play with the older youth of my community. I vividly remember my mimicking of their starting techniques and use of a clap to start the race.  As I grew older, I began to acquaint myself with my counterparts and was awarded the opportunity to play race. I remember my very first race: it was with two boys: Toots and Cody, and a girl, SueAnn, who were all older than I am. I placed second, with Toots finishing infront me.</p>
                <p>Since then, i've never stopped running competitively. I was a part of both my primary and high school track teams, where I represented at the national level. In 2021, I was even the tenth fastest athlete within my age range for the competitive period: January to March. From Track and Field, I have made my most invaluable and priceless friendships. Each time I think of the journey, though rigorous, I express gratitude for the children in my community who initially sparked my interest.</p>

                <h2> My Pageantry Journey </h2>

                <p> I grew up as a tomboy, fully immersing myself in sporting activities while shying away from all things having to do with dolls so I would have NEVER thought of entering a pageant.One day though, while I was at graduation rehearsal, I got a call from JCDC and the manager says, "You've been recommended to compete in the Miss St.James Festival Queen Competition". Of course, I assured her that she had called the wrong number and suggested that she try to get in contact wih whomever she initially intended to speak with. Surprisingly, she then called MY name and informed me of training sessions I would have to attend. Still out of touch, I told her that I would return her call the next day then hurriedly phoned my father, who instantaneously agreed that I join.</p>
                <p>Having followed my dad's instructions and after months of grit, the coronation took place and I was crowned "Miss St.James Festival Queen 2023". I not only walked away with a crown; but also an increased mindfulness and need to embrace my superpower: my femininity. </p>
